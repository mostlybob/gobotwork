- well, got ping to at least upload, but it's still not giving me much
  - I saw the message that it started the probe, but that was it
- still sorting out when I need to upload firmata to the device
  - I've been using the Arduino IDE, but I wonder if flipping between it and SublimeText might be getting in the way
- went back to try it again and now it doesn't go; just has TX & RX lit up
  - interesting - when I switch away from the console window and then back, it kills the run
  - it looks like it's initializing the firmata connection, the pins and the LED, then initializing the bot, then starting the connections, then nothing
- blink responds the same way
  - tried re-uploading firmata from Arduino IDE
    - no effect
  - tried unplugging it & plugging it back in, & go running blink
    - no effect
  - tried unplugging it & plugging it back in, re-uploading firmata from Arduino IDE & go running blink
    - no effect
- so it seems like I'm back where (I thought) I was when I sat down: thinking it wasn't working, uploading firmata and boom, blink works, then try ping and puts it back to this
- pretty sure I have the hardware for ping connected correctly, but that might be something
